# Clips & Sequences Overview

Transform your episodes into shareable clips and professional sequences.

## Two Powerful Tools

### Clips: Short-Form Content
Create individual video clips optimized for social media:
- 15-60 second clips from highlights

- One-click downloads

### Sequences: Long-Form Editing
Arrange multiple clips and highlights into timeline-based videos:
- Timeline editing interface
- Multi-track support
- Precise timing control
- Professional output
- Full episode edits or compilations

## Clips vs Sequences

| Feature | Clips | Sequences |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Short social content | Longer edited videos |

## When to Use Each

### Use Clips When:
- Creating social media content
- Need multiple short videos quickly
- Want consistent formatting
- Batch processing many moments
- Simple extract-and-share workflow

### Use Sequences When:
- Building longer-form content

- Multi-platform content strategy
- Maximize content from one episode

## Aspect Ratios Explained

### 9:16 (Vertical)
- **Best for**: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Stories
- **Dimensions**: 1080 x 1920
- **Orientation**: Portrait (tall)
- **Why**: Fills mobile screens

### 1:1 (Square)
- **Best for**: Instagram Feed, Facebook Feed, LinkedIn
- **Dimensions**: 1080 x 1080
- **Orientation**: Square
- **Why**: Works on all feeds, no cropping

### 16:9 (Horizontal)
- **Best for**: YouTube, Facebook Video, LinkedIn Video
- **Dimensions**: 1920 x 1080
- **Orientation**: Landscape (wide)
- **Why**: Traditional video format

### 4:5 (Portrait-ish)
- **Best for**: Instagram Feed (portrait)
- **Dimensions**: 1080 x 1350
- **Orientation**: Slightly tall
- **Why**: Maximum space in Instagram feed

### Custom Ratios
- Set your own width:height
- Specific platform requirements
- Experimental formats

**Recommendation**: Start with 9:16 for Stories/Reels, 1:1 for Feed posts, 16:9 for YouTube.

## Captions

**Customization coming soon**: Full control over fonts, colors, positioning, animations.

## Processing

### How Processing Works

1. **Submit**: Configure and click "Generate"
2. **Queue**: Job added to processing queue
3. **Processing**: Cloud workers render your clip/sequence
   - Extract video segment
   - Apply cropping
   - Generate captions
   - Encode final video
4. **Complete**: Ready for download
5. **Notify**: Notification when done

### Processing Time

**Clips**:
- 30-second clip: 1-2 minutes
- 60-second clip: 2-3 minutes
- Factors: crop settings, captions, server load

**Sequences**:
- Depends on total duration and complexity
- Typically 1/4 real-time (4-minute sequence = 1 min processing)

### Status Tracking

Four states:
- **Pending**: Queued, waiting to process
- **Processing**: Actively rendering (shows percentage)
- **Completed**: Ready to download
- **Failed**: Error occurred (shows error message)

**Auto-refresh**: Status updates automatically every 3 seconds.

## Exporting

### Clip Downloads
- Click **Download** button on completed clip
- Downloads as MP4 file
- Filename: `{episode-name}-{clip-name}.mp4`
- Ready to upload to social platforms

### Metadata Export
Export clip information as:
- **CSV**: Spreadsheet with all clip data
- **JSON**: Structured data for integrations
- **TXT**: Human-readable list

**Useful for**: Documentation, tracking, sharing clip lists with team.

## Best Practices

### Clip Creation
âœ… Create highlights first, then generate clips from them
âœ… Use descriptive names for organization
âœ… Batch process multiple clips at once
âœ… Test one clip before creating many
âœ… Match aspect ratio to target platform
âœ… Enable captions for social media clips

### Sequence Building
âœ… Plan your structure before building
âœ… Create all needed highlights first
âœ… Arrange chronologically or thematically
âœ… Preview before final render
âœ… Leave buffer between segments
âœ… Match frame rate to source video

### Organization
âœ… Name clips clearly (platform + topic)
âœ… Tag with target platform
âœ… Track which clips are posted
âœ… Delete unused clips to save space
âœ… Export metadata for records
