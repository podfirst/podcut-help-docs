See [Highlights Overview](../05-highlights/01-highlights-overview.md).

### How does AI highlight generation work?

AI analyzes your episode's:
- Transcript content
- Audio characteristics
- Emotional peaks
- Topic transitions

Then suggests 10-20 highlights for you to review, edit, or delete.

### How many highlights should I create?

**Typical**: 10-20 highlights per hour of content.

Create as many as useful! More highlights = more potential clips.

### Can I generate clips from highlights?

Yes! That's the main purpose. Click any highlight → Generate Clip → Configure settings → Process → Download.

One highlight can generate multiple clips with different formats (vertical, square, horizontal).

## Clips & Sequences

### What's the difference between clips and sequences?
