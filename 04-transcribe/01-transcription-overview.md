# Transcription Overview

AI-powered transcription with speaker identification transforms your audio into searchable, editable text.

## What is Transcription?

Transcription converts spoken audio from your episode into written text with:
- **Word-level timestamps**: Every word linked to exact video moment
- **Speaker diarization**: Automatic identification of different speakers
- **High accuracy**: 85-95% accuracy depending on audio quality
- **Fast processing**: ~1/6th real-time (10 min audio = ~1-2 min processing)

## Why Transcribe?

### Editing Benefits

- **Create highlights**: Select text to mark key moments
- **Export subtitles**: Generate caption files automatically
- **Accessibility**: Make content accessible to deaf/hard-of-hearing

### Content Repurposing

### SEO Benefits

## How It Works

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Upload Video**: Your episode is uploaded to Podcut
2. **Initiate**: Click "Transcribe" button
3. **AI Processing**: AssemblyAI processes your audio
   - Extracts audio track
   - Identifies speakers
   - Transcribes speech
   - Generates timestamps
4. **Delivery**: Transcript appears in your episode (5-10 min)

### Technology

Powered by **AssemblyAI**:
- Industry-leading accuracy
- Multiple language support
- Advanced speaker diarization

## Transcript Structure

### Segments
Transcript is broken into **segments** - portions spoken by one person:

```
[Speaker 0] (00:00:12.500)
"Welcome to episode 5 of the Marketing Mastery podcast."

[Speaker 1] (00:00:18.200)
"Thanks for having me! Excited to be here."
```

### Speakers
Speakers are auto-detected and labeled:
- Speaker 0, Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.
- You edit these to real names
- Names update throughout transcript

### Words
Each word has:
- **Text**: The spoken word
- **Start time**: When it begins (ms)
- **End time**: When it ends (ms)
- **Confidence**: AI's certainty (0-1)

## Transcription Accuracy

### What Affects Accuracy?

**Audio Quality** (biggest factor):
- ✅ Clear, close-mic'd audio: 90-95% accuracy
- ⚠️ Room mic, some noise: 80-90% accuracy
- ❌ Poor audio, lots of noise: 60-80% accuracy

**Other Factors**:
- Multiple speakers talking over each other
- Strong accents or dialects
- Technical jargon or proper nouns
- Background music or noise

### Improving Accuracy

**Before Recording**:
- Use good microphone close to mouth
- Record in quiet environment
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace

**After Transcription**:
- Edit Mode to fix errors
- Add custom vocabulary (coming soon)
- Re-transcribe if needed

## Language Support

### Supported Languages

Default: **English (en-GB)**

Other languages supported:
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Italian (it)
- Portuguese (pt)
- Dutch (nl)

### Selecting Language

1. Click **Transcribe** button
2. Select language from dropdown
3. Start transcription

**Note**: Language must be set before transcription. To change language, you must re-transcribe.

## Speaker Diarization

### What is Diarization?

Automatic identification of "who spoke when" in audio with multiple speakers.

### How It Works

AI analyzes audio characteristics:
- Voice pitch and tone
- Speech patterns
- Timing of speech
- Acoustic features

Then groups words by likely speaker.

### Diarization Accuracy

**Works Best With**:
- 2-4 distinct voices
- Clear voice differences (pitch, gender, accent)
- Little speaker overlap
- Good audio quality

**Challenging Scenarios**:
- Similar-sounding voices
- Speakers talking over each other
- Phone/conference call audio
- 5+ speakers

### Editing Speaker Labels

1. Switch to **Edit Mode**
2. Click speaker name (e.g., "Speaker 0")
3. Type real name: "John Smith - Host"
4. Press Enter
5. Name updates everywhere

**Tip**: Use descriptive names like "Sarah - Guest Expert" to make transcript more readable.

## Transcript Navigation

### Jump to Video

- **Click any text**: Video jumps to that moment
- **Timestamps clickable**: Jump to exact time
- **Auto-scroll**: Transcript follows video playback (can disable)

### Search Transcript

- **Search box**: Find specific words or phrases

## Processing Time

Typical processing times:

| Audio Duration | Processing Time |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 10 minutes     | 1-2 minutes     |
| 30 minutes     | 3-5 minutes     |
| 1 hour         | 5-10 minutes    |
| 2 hours        | 10-20 minutes   |

**Factors affecting speed**:
- Current server load
- Audio quality (noisy audio takes longer)
- Number of speakers
- Language selected
