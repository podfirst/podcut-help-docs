- **Word-level timestamps**: Every word linked to exact video moment
- **Speaker diarization**: Automatic identification of different speakers

## Transcription Accuracy

### What Affects Accuracy?

**Audio Quality** (biggest factor):
- ✅ Clear, close-mic'd audio: 90-95% accuracy
- ⚠️ Room mic, some noise: 80-90% accuracy
- ❌ Poor audio, lots of noise: 60-80% accuracy

**Other Factors**:
- Multiple speakers talking over each other
- Strong accents or dialects
- Technical jargon or proper nouns
- Background music or noise

### Improving Accuracy

**Before Recording**:
- Use good microphone close to mouth
- Record in quiet environment
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace

**After Transcription**:
- Edit Mode to fix errors
- Add custom vocabulary (coming soon)
- Re-transcribe if needed

## Language Support

## Speaker Diarization

### What is Diarization?

Automatic identification of "who spoke when" in audio with multiple speakers.

### How It Works

AI analyzes audio characteristics:
- Voice pitch and tone
- Speech patterns
- Timing of speech
- Acoustic features

Then groups words by likely speaker.

### Diarization Accuracy

**Works Best With**:
- 2-4 distinct voices
- Clear voice differences (pitch, gender, accent)
- Little speaker overlap
- Good audio quality

**Challenging Scenarios**:
- Similar-sounding voices
- Speakers talking over each other
- Phone/conference call audio
- 5+ speakers

### Editing Speaker Labels

1. Switch to **Edit Mode**
2. Click speaker name (e.g., "Speaker 0")
3. Type real name: "John Smith - Host"
4. Press Enter
5. Name updates everywhere

**Tip**: Use descriptive names like "Sarah - Guest Expert" to make transcript more readable.

## Transcript Navigation

## Processing Time

Typical processing times:

| Audio Duration | Processing Time |
|----------------|-----------------|

| 30 minutes     | 3-5 minutes     |
| 1 hour         | 5-10 minutes    |
| 2 hours        | 10-20 minutes   |

**Factors affecting speed**:
- Current server load
